<h1><dfn>Low</dfn> and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique
called sous vide.<br> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
cooked to.<br> In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes
it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise.<br> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
before November 30.</p>

if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</small></p>
